# Replication of "Blood Is Thicker Than Water: Elite Kinship Networks and State Building in Imperial China"

We replicate the network analytics conducted by Dr. Wang from Harvard University

Original paper: Blood is Thicker Than Water: Elite Kinship Networks and State Building in Imperial China

Replication and revision questions are discussed below:

Figure 4:
In this part, we reproduce Figure 4 in the original paper. This figure showed the attitude of politicians. It was a bar plot that had the portion of the support for reform on the y-axis. A value of 1 represents a supportive attitude toward the reform, 0 represents the opposite attitude, and 0.5 stands for a moderate attitude (partially supporting the reform). A total of 63 politicians displayed an attitude toward the reform. The result suggests that 54% of the 63 politicians, which is 34 of them, supported the reform. 38% of them opposed the reform. The supportive and opposite attitude adds up to 92%, and we can see from these statistics that the competition driven by the reform was dramatic. However, the politiciansâ€™ attitude collected in this graph is not complete because many of the politicians did not display their attitude.
